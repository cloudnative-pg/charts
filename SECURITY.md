# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities on a regular cadence. Which versions
are eligible for receiving such patches can be found below:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| latest  | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do NOT raise a GitHub Issue to report a security vulnerability. Please report
(suspected) security vulnerabilities to **[security@paradedb.com](mailto:security@paradedb.com)**,
preferably with a proof of concept. You will receive a response from us within 24
hours. If the issue is confirmed, we will release a patch as quickly as
possible depending on complexity but historically within a few days.

Non-vulnerability-related security issues such as new ideas for security features
are welcome on GitHub Issues.
