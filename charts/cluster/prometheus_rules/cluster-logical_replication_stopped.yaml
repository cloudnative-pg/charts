    ParadeDB CloudNativePG Cluster's "{{ .namespace }}/{{ .cluster }}" "{{ "{{ .subname }}" }}" subscription is stopped.

    Status: {{ .labels.stop_reason }}

    The subscription is not actively replicating data. This could be intentional (disabled) or due to an issue preventing the subscription from working.
