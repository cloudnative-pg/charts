annotations:
  summary: CNPG Cluster less than 2 standby replicas.
  description: |-
    CloudNativePG Cluster "{{ .labels.job }}" has only {{ .value }} standby replicas, putting
    your cluster at risk if another instance fails. The cluster is still able to operate normally, although
    the `-ro` and `-r` endpoints operate at reduced capacity.

    This can happen during a normal fail-over or automated minor version upgrades. The replaced instance may
    need some time to catch-up with the cluster primary instance.

    This alarm will be constantly triggered if your cluster is configured to run with less than 3 instances.
    In this case you may want to silence it.
